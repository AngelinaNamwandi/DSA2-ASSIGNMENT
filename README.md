d(i) The compression algorithm most suited for compressing the messages sent between clients is Lossless data compression because lossless compression preserves the  intergrity of data and even after the compression and decompression of the data the original data remains exactly the same, no data is lost in the process. 
(ii) Worst Case Time Complexity of the code is O(n), the time taken to broadcast all the messages to the clients grows linearly with the number of connected clients.
